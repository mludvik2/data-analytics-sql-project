1. **Answer to question 1**

**Do wages increase in all industry branches over the years or some decrease?**



I choose to review data from all the years available, year by year, industry by industry, for years **2006 through to year 2018**. 

I grouped them into the difference calculation to see if there was a increase or decrease from the current wage versus the previous wage using the LAG function.



*My findings:*

There were *25 occurrences* where the wages declined that show that not all industry branches increased over this period.



Of the 19 industry branches:

* the wage trend in **16** industry branches declined
* the wage trend in **3** industry branches increased throughout the years of 2006 and 2018, these were: Zdravotní a sociální péče, Zpracovatelský průmysl and činnosti související s odpady a sanacemi

 

An anomaly was found 19 industry branches that have a decline in wages usually occurred in the **year 2013**.

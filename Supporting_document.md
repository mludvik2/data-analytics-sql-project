1. **Answer to question 1**

*Do wages increase in all industry branches over the years or some decrease?*



I chose to review data from all the years available, year by year, industry by industry, for years **2006 through to year 2018**.

I grouped them into the difference calculation to see if there was a increase or decrease from the current wage versus the previous wage using the LAG function.



*My findings:*

There were *25 occurrences* where the wages declined that show that not all industry branches increased over this period.



Of the 19 industry branches:

* the wage trend in **16** industry branches declined
* the wage trend in **3** industry branches increased throughout the years of 2006 and 2018, these were: Zdravotní a sociální péče, Zpracovatelský průmysl and činnosti související s odpady a sanacemi

 

An anomaly was found that there were 19 industry branches that have a decline in wages, usually occurred in the **year 2013**.

**2. Answer to question 2**

*How much milk (liters) and bread (kilograms) can a person buy with the average wage comparing the first available year vs. the last available year?*



*My findings:*

* in year **2006** you could buy **2 772,37 liters of milk**
* in year **20018**  you could buy **2862,5 liters of milk**
* in year **2006** you could buy **2482,5kg of bread**
* in year **2018** you could buy **2340,4kg of bread**



According to the data difference, you could buy *90.13 liters more of milk* and you could buy *142.11 kg less of bread*.

**3. Answer to question 3**

*Which food category has the slowest long-term growth (the lowest average year-on-year % increase)?*



**Formula:** Growth rate = ((price - previous price)/previous price) x 100



*Steps*:

1. **food growth** to get the average price per category/year
2. **food growth calculation** to calculate the year-on-year growth % for each category
3. **average** the growth % across years
4. **sort** the data



*My findings:*

The category that increases the slowest is **granulated** **sugar**, which in fact did not increase but **decreased in price**, with an average year-on-year growth of **-1.92%.**"

**4. Answer to question 4**

*Is there a year in which the growth of food prices was significantly (by more than 10%) higher than the growth of wages?*



*Steps:*

1. **food price growth** to get the average price per category/year
2. **food price growth calculation** to calculate the year-on-year growth % for each category
3. **wage growth** to get the average price per category/year
4. **wage growth calculation** to calculate the year-on-year growth % for each category
5. join both tables
6. **average** the growth % across years for price and wage
7. calculate the **difference** of food price growth (f) and wage growth (w), matching them by year
8. check which **year** would be filtered out



*My findings:*

There was **no year** in which the growth of food prices was significantly (by more than 10%) higher than the growth of wages

**5. Answer to question 5**

*Does the level of GDP influence changes in wages and food prices? In other words, if GDP rises significantly in a given year, does this result in noticeably higher growth in wages or food prices in the same or following year?*



*My findings:*

1. When **GDP grows, wages usually grow too,** sometimes with a small delay (approx. one year)
2. When **GDP falls, wages slow down** or even decrease  (eg. 2009-2010)
3. Food prices do not clearly follow GDP:

* &nbsp;	sometimes they increase even when GDP falls (eg. 2012-2013)
* &nbsp;	this means food prices depend more on other factors

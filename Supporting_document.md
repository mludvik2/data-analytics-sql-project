1. **Answer to question 1**



Regarding the question of whether wages are increasing in all industry branches over the years or decreasing in some. I choose to review data from all the years available, year by year, industry by industry, for year **2006 to 2018**. I decided to see what the years looked like year by year, and then group them into the difference calculation see if there was a increase or decrease from the current wage versus the previous wage using the LAG function.

Using this function there were *25 occurrences* where the wages declined that show that not all industry branches increased over this period.

 

Of the 19 industry branches:

* wage trend in **16** industry branches declined
* wage trend in **3** industry branches increased throughout the years of 2006 and 2018, these were: Zdravotní a sociální péče, Zpracovatelský průmysl and činnosti související s odpady a sanacemi

&nbsp;

An anomaly was found that in **year 2013**, 19 of these industry branches had a decline in wages.





--most odvetvi that have a decline usually shows up in 2013





----	--a view of wage and the previous\_wage year to year per industry per industry



---there are only 25 occurances where the wage trend declined from 19 branches, only 16 declined and 3 branches grew but did not 

---decline from during year and year

---decline from 2009

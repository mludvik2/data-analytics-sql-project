**SQL project - Food Prices and Wages Analysis**

*Author*: Michaela Papadimitriu Ludvikova



Dear Viewer,



This project **analyzes trends in wages and food prices** in the Czech Republic (questions 1 -4) and in question 5, **GDP growth** influence comparison with wage and food price changes.



*Structure and questions:*

1. [SQL primary table](https://github.com/mludvik2/data-analytics-sql-project/blob/main/Primary_table.sql):
   wage and food price data for the Czech Republic, aligned for common years.
2. [SQL secondary table](https://github.com/mludvik2/data-analytics-sql-project/blob/main/Secondary_table.sql):
   additional data on other European countries including GPD
3. Script for [question number 1](https://github.com/mludvik2/data-analytics-sql-project/blob/main/Question_1.sql):
   Do wages increase in all industry branches over the years or some decrease?
4. Script for [question number 2](https://github.com/mludvik2/data-analytics-sql-project/blob/main/Question_2.sql):
   How much milk (liters) and bread (kilograms) can a person buy with the average wage comparing the first available year vs. the last available year?
5. Script for [question number 3](https://github.com/mludvik2/data-analytics-sql-project/blob/main/Question_3.sql):
   Which food category has the slowest long-term growth (the lowest average year-on-year % increase)?
6. Script for [question number 4](https://github.com/mludvik2/data-analytics-sql-project/blob/main/Question_4.sql):
   Is there a year in which the growth of food prices was significantly (by more than 10%) higher than the growth of wages?
7. Script for [question number 5](https://github.com/mludvik2/data-analytics-sql-project/blob/main/Question_5.sql):

&nbsp;  Does the level of GDP influence changes in wages and food prices? In other words, if GDP rises significantly in a given year, 

&nbsp;  does this result in noticeably higher growth in wages or food prices in the same or following year?
